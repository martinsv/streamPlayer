*** djcrackhome's streamPlayer ***

> Description of this script:
    streamPlayer is an easy to use web-player for Nullsoft's SHOUTcast Server stream.
    It is written in HTML5 with flash fallback. It uses Apple iTunes' search API to collect
    the cover information of the current track.

    To edit the config file in e.g. 'define('STREAM_HOSTNAME', '127.0.0.1');' you will need
    to change the string "127.0.0.1" (without the " ) to your desired hostname. Please do
    so with all other constants.

    Current setting is set to split on '-', so e.g.
    *   Psy - Gangnam Style
    Then the artist would be: 'Psy', and title 'Gangnam Style', after being trimmed.
    The current title will be searched over Apple iTunes' search API, check this URL to
    collect more information about this service (More search APIs will be added in the future):
    *   http://www.apple.com/itunes/affiliates/resources/documentation/itunes-store-web-service-search-api.html#searching

    The HTML file is HTML5-valid, and the script's CSS file is valid with CSS3, too.

> How-to get started:
    # Open config/settings.php with a file editor
    # Change all necessary constants
    # Upload all files onto your web-space and enjoy :)
